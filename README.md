# simple-youtube-downloader-gui
As the same would suggest this is a simple youtube downloader with a gui. 
I essentially just reused the code from my other repository with the same name if you exclude the gui part.

now it's not really perfect but I did also make it in just a few hours while learning about tkinter. I had an issue with the window becoming unresponsive when downloading a playlist and if you actually spam it it will crash. Not sure if the issue will get replicated on your end. 
One note I'd like to make is that I actually replaced the original .py file with a .pyw file which only really prevents the command prompt from opening up.

# future plans 
None at the moment. 

# Requirements:
pytube - (in the command prompt) 
py -m pip install pytube
