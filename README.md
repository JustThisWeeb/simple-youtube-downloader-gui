# simple-youtube-downloader-gui
As the same would suggest this is a simple youtube downloader with a gui. 
I essentially just reused the code from my other repository with the same name if you exclude the gui part.

now it's not really perfect but I did also make it in just a few hours while learning about tkinter. 
I noticed that when downloading a playlist the window stops being responsive which I thought was because the updates were too quick but even after adding a 2 second delay between the changes it still didn't really do anything. I might try to fix it at some point in the future. The thing is that I think it's either a problem with tkinter or my local problem. I might try adding threading and see if it fixes the issue and if it does I will make a new commit to this repo

# future plans 
I am planning on adding a progress bar window and fixing the unresponsive when downloading playlists issues 

# Requirements:
pytube - py -m pip install pytube in command prompt
